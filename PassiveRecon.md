Passive reconnaissance, you rely on publicly available knowledge. It is the knowledge that you can access from publicly available resources without directly engaging with the target. Think of it like you are looking at target territory from afar without stepping foot on that territory. Examples: 
   - Looking up DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server.
   - Checking job ads related to the target website.
   - Reading news articles about the target company.
  
Active reconnaissance, on the other hand, cannot be achieved so discreetly. It requires direct engagement with the target. Think of it like you check the locks on the doors and windows, among other potential entry points. Example:
   - Connecting to one of the company servers such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.
   - Calling the company in an attempt to get information (social engineering).
   - Entering company premises pretending to be a repairman.
   - Considering the invasive nature of active reconnaissance, one can quickly get into legal trouble unless one obtains proper legal authorization.


#### Fundamental Three Command Line Tools:
- whois to query WHOIS servers
- nslookup to query DNS servers
- dig to query DNS servers

Note: We use whois to query WHOIS records, while we use nslookup and dig to query DNS database records. These are all publicly available records and hence do not alert the target.

#### Fundamental Passive Recon Online Service Tools:
- DNSDumpster
- Shodan.io

These two online services allow us to collect information about our target without directly connecting to it.
