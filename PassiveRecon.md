#### Fundamental Three Command Line Tools:
- whois to query WHOIS servers
- nslookup to query DNS servers
- dig to query DNS servers

Note: We use whois to query WHOIS records, while we use nslookup and dig to query DNS database records. These are all publicly available records and hence do not alert the target.

#### Fundamental Passive Recon Online Service Tools:
- DNSDumpster
- Shodan.io

These two online services allow us to collect information about our target without directly connecting to it.
