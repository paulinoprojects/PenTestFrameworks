# Metasploit Basics
- Metasploit is the most widely used exploitation framework.
- Metasploit is a powerful tool that can support all phases of a penetration testing engagement, from information gathering to post-exploitation.

- Metasploit has two main versions:
  - Metasploit Pro: The commercial version that facilitates the automation and management of tasks. This version has a graphical user interface (GUI).
  - Metasploit Framework: The open-source version that works from the command line. This room will focus on this version, installed on the AttackBox and most commonly used penetration testing Linux distributions.
 
- The Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more. While the primary usage of the Metasploit Framework focuses on the penetration testing domain, it is also useful for vulnerability research and exploit development.

- The main components of the Metasploit Framework can be summarized as follows;
    - msfconsole: The main command-line interface.
    - Modules: supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.
    - Tools: Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing. Some of these tools are msfvenom, pattern_create and pattern_offset. We will cover msfvenom within this module, but pattern_create and pattern_offset are tools useful in exploit development which is beyond the scope of this module.
 
## Metasploit Terminology 
Before diving into the console, it would be helpful to clarify a few recurring concepts: 
- Exploit: A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
- Vulnerability: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.
- Payload: An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.
